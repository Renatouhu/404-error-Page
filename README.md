- Where can I see your demo?
I Deploy the project in Vercel, you can access <a href="https://404-error-page-orcin.vercel.app/">here</a> 
- What was your experience?
Interesting, i spend a bit time to know to center the Main element in page, because i didn't understand about the size of the elements in the page, so i kept on the search for the solution. 
- What have you learned/improved?
Using Media Queries for responsive design in the desktop/Mobile models, using REM unity in Font-size, Line Heights, Letter Spacing.
- Your wisdom? :)
In the last few days i've been practice in some web sites and i can feel a better understating about the Responsive sites.
